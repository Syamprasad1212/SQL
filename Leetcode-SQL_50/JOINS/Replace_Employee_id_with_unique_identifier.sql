/*Query*/

Select eu.unique_id,e.name from Employees e LEFT JOIN EmployeeUNI eu ON e.id=eu.id;

/*Step 1: Find Output

Ask:

Which columns do I need?
Step 2: Find Common Key
id
employee_id
customer_id
product_id

Use in:

ON table1.id = table2.id
Step 3: Choose JOIN

Need all rows from first table?

✅ YES → LEFT JOIN

❌ NO → INNER JOIN

Step 4: Missing Records Pattern
LEFT JOIN ...
WHERE right_table.id IS NULL

Used for:

Customers who never ordered
Employees without managers
Users without transactions
Step 5: Self Join

Same table joined with itself:

Employee e
JOIN Employee m

Examples:

Employee → Manager
